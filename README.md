# Day-7-String

üåü Day 7/365 of My 365 Days of Code Challenge! üíª‚ú®
Today, I took a deep dive into the world of strings and explored some of the most essential string methods and concepts that every programmer needs to master. üåê
I started by working with methods like .length(), .toLowerCase(), and .toUpperCase() to manipulate and analyze strings. From there, I moved on to methods like .trim() for cleaning up extra spaces and .substring() for extracting parts of a string. It‚Äôs amazing how much power lies in these simple methods when it comes to processing text!

I also explored methods like .replace() to swap out specific characters or sequences, as well as .startsWith() and .endsWith() to check the beginning or end of a string. The .charAt() method helped me locate individual characters, while .indexOf() and .lastIndexOf() made finding character positions super easy.

A major highlight was working with .equals() and .equalsIgnoreCase(), which clarified the importance of case sensitivity when comparing strings. And to wrap things up, I explored Escape Sequence Characters, like \n for new lines and \t for tabs, which are invaluable for formatting output.
